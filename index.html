        <h1>Black British commerce in Reading: a history</h1>
        <p>The history of black and other ethnic minority communities in Reading, a town in the UK which was once a regional hub for business and trade, stretches as far back as the Roman Empire. The story begins more than 2,000 years ago when the Romans conquered Britain and follows through to the British Empire during the slave trade era, and then through the Christian missionaries and continues even today.</p>
    </br>
        <p>Business enterprises of black and other ethnic minority communities are clearly visible as part of this vibrant townâ€™s commercial and cultural environments. This website showcases and signposts residents and visitors of Reading, to places in-person and online where they can find and experience products and services that originate from and are owned by people of these historical communities. By doing this, we hope to meet market demands, drive growth, and facilitate further integration of communities through commercial and cultural interactions. Please delve into my pages!</p>
