## Project Overview
- Include a picture of site that shows it in responsive states and links to deployed code: http://ami.responsivedesign.is/
My  idea is to provide value to users by providing easy and direct access to household, personal care and food products ordinarily used and prevalent in black and ethnic minority communities. I decided to focus on the market in, Reading, UK, the town where I live.
- [deployed website](https://oonyekpe.github.io/black-businesses-in-reading/)



## UX


#### Images

I walked around ethnically diverse areas of my town and took pictures of black-owned businesses. I feel these images give a real-life impact to users and their vibrant colours would invite potential customers to the businesses.

#### Animations and Transitions

The home page has a zoom in and out effect on the mural hero image.

The footer icons rotate to the left and zoom in when hovered over, and change colour.

### Wireframes

I created a Word document and saved it as a PDF as my [wireframe](https://github.com/oonyekpe/black-businesses-in-reading/blob/main/Project1-BlackBusinessInReading.pdf).

### Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so and how they tie into  your user stories.

#### Implemented Features

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

It's easiest to break this section down into the header, footer, and each page/layer of your website. Call out any differences for mobile vs desktop presentations, include a screenshot of the implemented feature.

Don't forget your 404 error page.

#### Future Features

Use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

If you end up not developing some features you hoped to implement, you can include those in this section.


## Testing


### Validation Testing


- I used the [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and pasted in my deployed url and checked it.

- I used the [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and copied my three web pages into it to check them.

**Home Page**

**Businesses Page**

**Contact Us Page**

### Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing
Create a table that lists out what devices, browsers, and operating system you tested your application on and a brief description of why you chose the mixture you did. The point is to prove that you looked at the site across various browsers, operating systems, and viewport breakpoints.

| TOOL / Device                      | BROWSER     | OS         |
|------------------------------------|-------------|------------|
| real phone: Nokia X20              | chrome      | android    |
| real phone: Moto G20               | chrome      | android    |
| real computer: DELL Latitude E7440 | Edge        | Windows 10 |


### Manual Testing

### Homepage

- [x] All navigation points go where they should.
- [x] All footer links open new tabs because they are not on the website.
- [x] Looks nice on desktops.
- [x] Looks nice on phones.

### Businesses page

- [x] All navigation points go where they should.
- [x] All footer links open new tabs because they are not on the website.
- [x] All business website links open new tabs because they are not on this website.
- [x] Looks nice on desktops.
- [x] Looks nice on phones.

### Contact Us page
- [x] All navigation points go where they should.
- [x] All footer links open new tabs because they are not on the website.
- [x] Looks right on desktops.
- [x] Error messages are seen if fields are empty.
- [x] After successful submission of the form it leads to CI's website.

### Defects of Note
- Removed the <br> from html files so that it would validate.
- Removed a space between the numbers and px so that the style.css file would validate
- Added a target=blank to my form so that the CI's datadump page would open in a different tab.



### Outstanding Defects
When tested on mobile phones, the homepage looks good initially, but after the image zooms in there is an unexpected wierd white spacing at the top right side, and a grey colour to the right side.

I chose not to fix this because it does not affect the functionality of the website, users can still click to other pages. I ran out of time to ask for tutor's help.

## Accessibility

I used https://web.dev/measure/  to check how my website was for accessibility.

**Home page**
